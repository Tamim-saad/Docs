# **Day 1**

## **What is DevOps?**

DevOps isn't just a tool or a job title; it's more like a *culture* or *practice* you adopt in an organization to make things run smoother1. The main goal? Speed up how you deliver applications or software while keeping everything high-quality.

* **Core Definition**: DevOps is a process that improves an organization's ability to deliver applications quickly and efficiently1.

* **Key Pillars** (focus on these to understand the big picture):

  * **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks to reduce manual work and speed things up1.

  * **Quality**: Ensure the software is reliable and meets standards—no cutting corners1.

  * **Continuous Monitoring (or Observability)**: Keep an eye on your systems to spot issues early and fix them fast1.

  * **Continuous Testing**: Test everything regularly to catch bugs before they become big problems1.

* **Real-World Example**: If a company like Android finds a security bug in their app, DevOps helps them fix and release an update in hours or days, not weeks1. Without it, delivery might take 10 days or more due to slow processes.

*Tip for Beginners*: Don't get hung up on fancy terms like CI/CD yet (that's Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery)—they'll come later. For now, remember DevOps is about making delivery *faster and better* by combining these elements1.

## **Why DevOps? (The Backstory)**

Understanding *why* DevOps exists helps you see its value, especially in interviews. It evolved to fix problems in old-school software development from about 10 years ago1.

* **Problems in the Past** (Before DevOps):

  * Multiple roles were involved: Developers wrote code, System Administrators created servers, Build & Release Engineers deployed apps, Server Administrators managed app servers, and Testers checked everything1.

  * This led to slow, manual processes—think 10 days to a month just to get an app from a developer's laptop to customers1.

  * Lots of handoffs between teams meant delays, miscommunication, and inefficiencies1.

* **How DevOps Fixes It**:

  * It brings everyone into *one team* with a shared culture, automating the whole pipeline from code to customer1.

  * Result: Faster delivery (e.g., from weeks to days or hours), less manual effort, and better collaboration1.

* **End Goal**: As a DevOps engineer, your job is to cut delivery time (e.g., from 2 weeks to 1 week) while maintaining automation, quality, monitoring, and testing1.

*Learning Note*: Compare this to manufacturing— like making chips or biscuits. Automation speeds production, but you still need quality checks, monitoring, and testing to keep customers happy1. Google "DevOps evolution" for more examples, but stick to reliable sources to avoid confusion.

## **How to Introduce Yourself in a DevOps Interview**

Interviews often start with "Tell me about yourself," so nail this to make a strong first impression. Keep it confident, honest, and tied to DevOps basics1.

* **Structure Your Intro**:

  * **Start with Your Experience**: "I'm a DevOps engineer with X years of experience in the field. Before that, I worked as a \[system admin/build & release engineer/developer/etc.\]1."

    * If you're a fresher: "I'm new to DevOps but passionate about it—I've been learning through courses and projects1."

    * Be realistic: DevOps has only been popular for 7-8 years, so don't claim 10+ years1.

  * **Highlight Your Background**: Mention past roles to show how they relate (e.g., "My system admin experience helps with server management in AWS1.").

  * **Tie in DevOps Pillars**: "In my current role, I focus on automation, maintaining code quality, setting up continuous monitoring, and integrating testing into the pipeline1."

  * **Optional: Tools (If Asked)**: Briefly mention what you use, like GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Kubernetes for orchestration, Ansible for configuration, or Terraform for infrastructure1. But don't overload—save details for later questions.

* **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:

  * Don't rush; take time to explain if needed (it's okay to go beyond 1-2 minutes)1.

  * Be honest—exaggerating experience (e.g., claiming 10 years in DevOps) will backfire1.

  * Practice this out loud to sound natural.

*Beginner Tip*: Role-play this with a friend or in front of a mirror. It builds confidence and helps you connect your story to why you're a great fit.

## **Day-to-Day Activities as a DevOps Engineer**

The transcript touches on this as a common interview question ("What are your day-to-day activities?"). It's basically what you do to support the pillars above1.

* **Typical Tasks**:

  * Automate deployments and processes to speed up delivery1.

  * Ensure quality through code reviews and standards1.

  * Set up monitoring tools to track system health and alert on issues1.

  * Integrate continuous testing into workflows1.

* **Interview Answer Idea**: "On a typical day, I work on automating pipelines, monitoring app performance, running tests, and collaborating with teams to improve delivery speed1."

*Pro Tip*: This will vary by company, so research the job description. As a beginner, focus on learning tools that support these activities.

# **Day 2**

## **What is Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?**

SDLC is a standard process followed in the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality products[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/). It's essential for everyone in IT—developers, testers, or DevOps engineers—to understand, as it ensures consistent, efficient work across organizations, from startups to big companies like Amazon or Flipkart.

* **End Goal**: Deliver reliable, high-quality software that meets customer needs quickly[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false).

* **Why Learn It?** It provides a structured framework; skipping steps like testing can lead to poor products and unhappy users[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false).

* **High-Level Phases**: Design, develop, test—but it's more detailed, forming a cycle for ongoing improvements[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/).

*Beginner Insight*: Think of SDLC as a recipe for building software. Without it, things get messy, like baking without measuring ingredients.

## **Phases of SDLC (With Example)**

Using the transcript's example of "example.com" (an e-commerce site adding a kids clothing section), here's how SDLC works in practice. It's a circular process, repeating for each new feature[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false).

## **1\. Planning and Requirements Gathering**

* Gather inputs from customers, business analysts, or product owners to define needs[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false).

* Example: Research if customers want kids' clothes (e.g., age ranges 1-4 or 6-12 years) and collect feedback[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false).

* Importance: This stage decides if the idea is worth pursuing—stop here if it's not viable to save time[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false).

## **2\. Defining and Designing**

* **Defining**: Document requirements in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) doc[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false).

* **Designing**: Create High-Level Design (HLD) for overall system (e.g., scalability for holidays) and Low-Level Design (LLD) for specifics like functions, databases (e.g., MySQL), and modules[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false).

* Involves architects or senior team members[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false).

## **3\. Building (Developing)**

* Developers write code based on designs, using languages like Java or Python[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false)[4](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-is-devops).

* Code is reviewed by peers and pushed to a repository like Git for sharing[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false)[4](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-is-devops).

* Focus: Turn plans into actual software[4](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-is-devops).

## **4\. Testing**

* Quality Assurance (QA) engineers test the code on servers (e.g., staging) for bugs[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false)[4](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-is-devops).

* If issues found, fix and retest to ensure quality before release[4](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-is-devops).

## **5\. Deployment**

* Promote tested code to production servers for customers to use[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false)[4](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-is-devops).

* The cycle repeats for new features[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false).

*Learning Note*: SDLC models vary (e.g., Waterfall, Iterative, Agile)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/). Most modern teams use Agile for short sprints and quick iterations[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/).

## **How DevOps Improves SDLC**

DevOps isn't just tools—it's a culture that automates and speeds up SDLC, especially building, testing, and deployment, to boost efficiency without manual errors15[6](https://cesltd.com/impact-of-devops-on-software-development/)[7](https://dzone.com/articles/the-role-of-devops-in-enhancing-the-software-devel).

* **Key Focus Areas for DevOps Engineers**:

  * **Automate Building**: Streamline code development and integration15.

  * **Automate Testing**: Run continuous tests to catch issues early5[6](https://cesltd.com/impact-of-devops-on-software-development/).

  * **Automate Deployment**: Push code to production quickly and reliably15[7](https://dzone.com/articles/the-role-of-devops-in-enhancing-the-software-devel).

* **Benefits**:

  * Faster delivery: Reduces time from weeks to hours/days by automating processes1[6](https://cesltd.com/impact-of-devops-on-software-development/)[7](https://dzone.com/articles/the-role-of-devops-in-enhancing-the-software-devel).

  * Better collaboration: Breaks silos between teams for shared responsibility[6](https://cesltd.com/impact-of-devops-on-software-development/)[7](https://dzone.com/articles/the-role-of-devops-in-enhancing-the-software-devel).

  * Higher efficiency: Automation leads to fewer errors, quicker feedback, and scalable systems5[6](https://cesltd.com/impact-of-devops-on-software-development/)[8](https://www.ijfans.org/uploads/paper/1c6c600fc468da1b4e9fdf54e9538994.pdf).

  * Improved quality: Ensures continuous monitoring and testing5[8](https://www.ijfans.org/uploads/paper/1c6c600fc468da1b4e9fdf54e9538994.pdf).

*Example in Action*: For the kids section, DevOps automates deploying updates so customers get it fast, without manual handoffs1.

*Pro Tip*: As a DevOps learner, always think: "How can this tool (e.g., Terraform) improve my organization's efficiency?" Not every popular tool fits every team[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false).

## **Interview Prep: SDLC and DevOps Questions**

* **Common Question**: "What are the pillars of SDLC, and which interest you as a DevOps engineer?"

  * Answer: List phases (planning, designing, building, testing, deployment). Focus on automating building, testing, deployment for efficiency[2](https://videohighlight.com/v/jRqBIpcgO4g?mediaType=youtube&language=en&summaryType=default&summaryId=6IhJPkR0TZ2ioLa5KZXv&aiFormatted=false)5\.

* **Your Role**: Emphasize improving processes via automation to reduce manual work and speed up delivery5[7](https://dzone.com/articles/the-role-of-devops-in-enhancing-the-software-devel).

*Beginner Tip*: Practice explaining SDLC with a simple app example. Role-play interviews to build confidence.

# **Day 3(a)**

## **Different Roles in an Organization**

Organizations (e.g., Amazon) have multiple projects (e.g., Amazon Fresh). Requirements start with customers and flow through roles before reaching DevOps engineers1. This hierarchy ensures ideas are refined and prioritized.

* **Customers**: Provide feedback and needs (e.g., "Deliver groceries in 15 minutes").

* **Business Analyst (BA)**: Gathers requirements, creates Business Requirements Documents (BRD), and interacts with customers and business teams.

* **Product Manager (PM)**: Prioritizes requirements based on vision, market, and competitors (e.g., schedules Q1 for high-priority features like quick delivery).

* **Product Owner (PO)**: Breaks priorities into actionable items called epics or features (e.g., UI for mobile, backend setup).

* **Solutions Architect (SA)**: Designs technical plans with High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD).

* **Development (Scrum) Team**: Includes developers, DevOps engineers, QA engineers, database admins (DBA), Site Reliability Engineers (SRE), and technical writers. They implement, test, and maintain.

  * **Your Role as DevOps Engineer**: Get tasks from developers (e.g., set up Kubernetes cluster, Git repos) to support implementation and improve efficiency.

* **QA Engineers**: Test for quality and bugs.

* **Database Administrators (DBA)**: Manage databases.

* **Site Reliability Engineers (SRE)**: Monitor post-deployment reliability, create dashboards, and handle alerts.

* **Technical Writers**: Document features for users (e.g., how a new app function works).

*Flow Example*: Customer requests fast delivery → BA creates BRD → PM prioritizes → PO makes epics → SA designs → Developers request infra (e.g., clusters) from DevOps → Team builds/tests/deploys → SRE maintains1.

*Learning Note*: DevOps bridges teams by automating from implementation onward, reducing delivery time (e.g., from months to weeks).

## **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Overview**

SDLC is the process for building software, and DevOps optimizes it by automating gaps1. It's complex due to many roles, but understanding it shows where you fit.

* **Phases**:

  * **Planning/Analysis**: Gather and prioritize requirements (BA/PM/PO).

  * **Design**: Create HLD/LLD (SA).

  * **Implementation**: Build code and infra (developers/DevOps).

  * **Testing/Integration**: Check quality (QA).

  * **Maintenance**: Monitor and fix (SRE).

* **DevOps Role**: Identify inefficiencies (e.g., manual testing) and automate (e.g., CI/CD pipelines for dev \+ QA, security scans). Goal: Shorten cycles while unifying efforts1.

*Example*: For a 15-minute delivery feature, DevOps automates deployment to cut time from 3 months to 21\.

*Pro Tip*: SDLC varies (e.g., Agile with sprints), but focus on how DevOps speeds up implementation, testing, and deployment.

## **Project Management with Jira**

Jira tracks tasks for visibility and accountability1. It's where requirements become your daily work—create a free account to practice.

* **Key Concepts**:

  * **Epics**: High-level features from PO (e.g., "15-minute delivery service").

  * **Stories**: Breakdowns of epics (e.g., "Create Kubernetes cluster").

  * **Sprints**: 2-3 week cycles in Scrum (Agile) for planning, working, and retrospectives (track progress, e.g., 60% done).

  * **Backlog**: List of pending stories; refine during planning.

* **How It Works for DevOps**:

  * PO creates epics → Team breaks into stories during sprint planning.

  * Stories like "Set up AWS RDS" get assigned to you.

  * Update status (To Do → In Progress → Done) and add comments (e.g., daily progress).

* **Why Use It?**: Management tracks blockers (e.g., budget issues) and appreciates fast work. Alternatives exist, but Jira is common1.

*Hands-On Tip*: Sign up at Atlassian, create a project (e.g., "Amazon Fresh"), add an epic, break into stories, and simulate a sprint. Check "Learn Jira in 5 Minutes" on their site.

## **Interview Prep: Common Questions**

* **Roles/SDLC**: "How do requirements reach DevOps engineers?" Answer: From customers → BA/PM/PO/SA → Developers request infra (e.g., clusters)1.

* **Jira/Sprints**: "How do you use Jira?" Answer: Track stories in sprints, update status/comments for visibility1.

* **DevOps Fit**: "What do you do beyond tasks?" Answer: Identify SDLC gaps and automate (e.g., CI/CD) to improve efficiency1.

*Beginner Tip*: Practice explaining the roles flow with the grocery delivery example. It shows you understand the "why" behind DevOps.

# **Day 3(b)**

## **What is a Server?**

A server is essentially a computer that hosts applications for public or team access. It's not your local laptop—it's where apps like google.com or amazon.com run so anyone can use them.

* **Key Idea**: Developers build apps on their laptops, but to deliver to customers, you deploy on a server.

* **Example**: Your organization's app (e.g., example.com) needs servers to handle user traffic, not just local testing.

*Beginner Insight*: Think of a server as a "public home" for your app—without it, no one outside your laptop can access it.

## **Physical Servers and the Problem of Inefficiency**

Physical servers are actual hardware bought from companies like HP or IBM. Organizations purchase them to run apps, but they often lead to waste.

* **How It Works**: Buy servers (e.g., 5 servers of varying sizes: 100GB RAM, 100 cores each).

* **Common Issue**: Teams deploy apps that use only a fraction of the server's capacity (e.g., an app needs 4GB RAM and 4 CPUs but the server has 100GB/100 cores—wasting 96GB/96 cores).

* **Real-World Scenario**: If 5 teams each get one server, but each app uses only 10% of resources, you're wasting 90% across all servers. This is inefficiency—high costs, underutilization.

*Learning Note*: DevOps focuses on efficiency. Here, physical servers highlight a "big rock" problem: resources going unused, like overbuying land you don't need.

## **Real-World Analogy: Land and Efficiency**

The transcript uses a simple analogy to explain inefficiency and how VMs fix it—super helpful for beginners\!

* **Step 1 (Inefficiency)**: You own 1 acre of plain land and build a house for your family (2-5 people). You live lavishly but realize you only need 0.5 acres—wasting the rest (e.g., unused park or garden).

* **Step 2 (Efficiency)**: Build another property on the unused 0.5 acres and rent it out. Now, two families live happily without interfering—same land, double the use, plus you get rent\!

* **Key Lesson**: Resources (land) are used efficiently. No one's comfort is lost; waste is eliminated. This mirrors DevOps: Improve resource use without disrupting teams.

*Pro Tip*: Visualize this—draw a quick sketch of the land divided logically (not physically). It shows how VMs add "rent" (efficiency) to servers.

## **Virtual Machines (VMs) and Hypervisors**

VMs solve inefficiency by creating logical (virtual) servers on one physical server, managed by a hypervisor.

* **What is a VM?**: A virtual environment that acts like a full computer system with its own CPU, memory, and hardware—but it's logical, not physical. VMs are isolated; one doesn't affect another.

* **Hypervisor's Role**: Software installed on a physical server (e.g., VMware or Xen) that creates and manages VMs. It does "logical partitioning"—dividing resources without breaking hardware.

* **How It Improves Efficiency**: On one 100GB/100-core physical server, create 5 VMs. Assign each to a team—now 5 apps run efficiently without waste. Teams get what they need (e.g., VM1: 4GB/4 cores) without over-provisioning.

* **Benefits**: Turns underused servers (10% utilization) into highly efficient ones (serving multiple teams). This is DevOps in action—automation via hypervisors boosts resource use.

*Beginner Tip*: VMs are "virtual" because they're not tangible—you access them logically (e.g., via IP address), not physically. Practice by installing Oracle VirtualBox on your laptop to create a simple VM.

## **Real-World Example: VMs in the Cloud (AWS)**

Cloud providers like AWS use VMs at scale to serve millions.

* **How It Works**: AWS builds data centers (e.g., in Mumbai, Singapore, Ohio) with millions of physical servers (racks of hardware).

* **Creating a VM**: From your laptop, request a VM via AWS portal or scripts (e.g., 10GB RAM, 12 cores in Mumbai region). AWS's hypervisor on a physical server creates it and sends you access details (IP, keys).

* **Why Regions Matter**: Choose Mumbai for low latency (faster access from India) vs. Ohio (higher latency).

* **Efficiency Boost**: One data center's physical servers can support millions of VMs/users, not just a few teams. You pay (e.g., $100) but get logical access only—no physical control.

*Learning Note*: This scales the land analogy: AWS "rents" VM "properties" on their massive "land" (data centers). Tomorrow's video (Part 2\) covers creating VMs live—preview if you can\!

## **Interview Prep: Common Questions on VMs**

* **"What is a virtual machine?"**: A logical server created on a physical one via hypervisor for efficient resource use—has its own CPU/memory/hardware but isn't physical.

* **"Why use VMs in DevOps?"**: They improve efficiency by reducing waste (e.g., from 10% to near-full utilization), enabling automation and scaling for faster delivery.

* **"Explain hypervisors with an example."**: Software like VMware that partitions physical servers logically. E.g., AWS uses them in data centers to create VMs on demand.
